# ENEL300-Boebot

This is the main code used for my ENEL 300 project (2nd year Electrical Engineering design class) in which the task is to navigate around a course using an Arduino Uno, two servo motors and 3 infrared sensors. 
This couldn't have been done without the help of my team members Devon, Akhil, and Levin!

The code used requires the 'StopWatch' library that can be found here: http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/StopWatchClass
Thanks to robtillaart.

## Required Materials
#### Arduino UNO
#### 6 Resistors (Values can be changed based on needs)
#### Arduino UNO Proto Shield
#### Wires
#### Computer with Arduino IDE
#### 2 Servo Motors
#### Battery holder and batteries
#### Chassis or Frame

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Boebot Hardware and Construction
1. Attach Arduino UNO to Protoshield
2. Construct your Chassis and attach battery pack
3. Attach servo motors on either side of the chassis
4. Attach Arduino UNO unit to chassis
5. Connect servo motor connectors to the Proto Shield digital pins
6. Wire the Transistor and IR LED as listed below
7. Repeat step 6 for the three LED's and Transistors

#### Note about resistances
The three IR LED's required resistances from left, middle, and right respectively of: 6.8k Ohms, 22k Ohms, and 1.5k Ohms. The main purpose of these resistors is to limit the range of each sensor and from our findings and code this was the best combination.

#### Note about wiring LED's
