# ENEL300-Boebot

This is the main code used for my ENEL 300 project (2nd year Electrical Engineering design class) in which the task is to navigate around a course using an Arduino Uno, two servo motors and 3 infrared sensors.
The code used requires the 'StopWatch' library that can be found here: http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/StopWatchClass
Thanks to robtillaart.

## Required Materials
#### Arduino UNO
#### 6 Resistors (Values can be changed based on needs)
#### Arduino UNO Proto Shield
#### Wires
#### Computer with Arduino IDE
#### 2 Servo Motors

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three IR LED's required resistances from left, middle, and right respectively of: 6.8k Ohms, 22k Ohms, and 1.5k Ohms.The main purpose of these resistors is to limit the range of each sensor and from our findings and code this was the best combination.
